# The Effect of Temporary Co-location on Knowledge Flows
## Evidence from NIH Study Sections

## Discovery of The Double Helix

Central figures: Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin 

**In 1951, Watson saw Wilkins present at a conference in Naples**

This encounter prompted Watson to move to Cambridge and change the direction of his research

---

## Research Question

Vast literature on spillovers, long-term interactions

"Cricket spills over into business" - Enrico Moretti's *The New Geography of Jobs*

--

What is the effect of short-term interactions on collaboration and knowledge diffusion?

Does networking have scientific value (collaborations, knowledge diffusion)? Or just "private" value (finding a job)?
    
&lt;!-- - Do people actually find new collaborators and learn new things at conferences? Or are the benefits mostly private? --&gt;

???

If you're a policy maker trying to encourage more knowledge diffusion then knowing scientific/private distinction is important
    
---

## Empirical challenges
 
Data on short-term interactions is hard to find

Endogeneity of colocation - people aren't randomly in the same place

Measurement

&lt;!--

## My approach

Quasi-experimental

Repeated interactions

Long-term outcomes

---

class: inverse, middle, center

## Setting

---

## NIH study sections

NIH panels that evaluate grant applications 

Convened by a Scientific Review Officer from the NIH

Organized around topics e.g. "Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy", "Cellular Signaling and Regulatory Systems"

---

## Criteria for reviewer selection

1. Expertise 

1. Study section must have enough breadth to cover its scientific area 

---

## Permanent vs. Temporary Members

Permanent members serve 4-year terms, 3 meetings a year

Temporary members are recruited on an ad hoc basis

Temporary memberships are sometimes used as tryouts for permanent membership

&lt;!-- Each meeting has on average 17 permanent and 13 temporary reviewers 
--&gt;

---

## What happens in a study section?

Each application is assigned 3 reviewers

Reviewers present their assessment of the application and discussion opens up to rest of panel

--

**What potential is there for knowledge diffusion?** What do reviewers actually talk about?

---

## Are reviewers different enough?

"I was always a minority, a clinical cardiologist, not an engineer. **So it was my job to defend cardiology science and explain it**" - Dr. David Sahn, Oregon Health Sciences University

---

## Do they learn from each other?

"I've come away grateful for the opportunity and consciously aware that **I learned some new science** and developed skills to **interact with people with different attitudes and opinions**" - Dr. Alice Clark, University of Mississippi

???

Suggests

1. reviewers are not entirely familiar with each other's fields
1. there are learning opportunities within the reviewing process

---

## Intellectual similarity

If scientists are too similar, may already be familiar with each other's work

If scientists are too distant, may be harder to use each other's knowledge

--

Effects may vary by intellectual similarity and could be non-monotonic

List of reviewers who attended a particular meeting for a particular study section

## Data

&lt;img src="spillovers_uea2018_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
--&gt;

## Setup

Scientist pair (not ordered): `\((i, j) \equiv (j, i)\)`

Pair-year panel

---

## Sample



Over 14000 individuals matched out of 19000

235 study sections

Each panel has 29 members on average

Time period: 1992 to 2010, but most meetings observed are in 2006 or earlier

# Estimation

---

## Identification

Limit to permanent members of study sections

Make use of fixed 4-year terms

---

## Identification 

&lt;img src="spillovers_uea2018_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Treatment intensity

&lt;img src="spillovers_uea2018_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Identifying assumption

Use reviewer-pairs who served within 3 years of each other 

If scientists `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` served on a study section, *when* they were on the study section is exogenous

---

## Model

`$$y_{ij, t} = \sum^{10}_{k = -10}\beta_k 1(K_{ij, t} = k)1(N_{ij} \in \{1, 2, 3\}) + \gamma_t + \delta_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij, t}$$`

`\(k \equiv\)` number of years since first colocation

`\(N_{ij} \equiv\)` number of years of overlap

`\(y_{ij,t} \equiv\)` number of times `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` have cited each other

`\(\delta_{ij} \equiv\)` pair fixed effects

`\(\gamma_t \equiv\)` year fixed effects

---

## Discussion

Repeated interactions matter - familiarity matters, not just awareness

Effects may be persistent

---

## Future work

Other outcome variables of interest: collaborations, text measures of intellectual distance

Compare results for temporary members

Estimate specification with more structure

---

## Conclusion

Repeated short-term interactions matter

Some evidence (not shown) that heterogeneity matters
