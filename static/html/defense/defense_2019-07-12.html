## The Effect of Temporary Colocation on Knowledge Flows: Evidence from NIH Study Sections

---

## Discovery of The Double Helix

Central figures: Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin 

**In 1951, Watson saw Wilkins present at a conference in Naples**

This encounter prompted Watson to move to Cambridge and change the direction of his research

---

## Research Question

Vast literature on spillovers, long-term interactions

"Cricket spills over into business" - Enrico Moretti's *The New Geography of Jobs*

--

What is the effect of short-term interactions on collaboration and knowledge diffusion?

---

## Empirical challenges
 
Data on short-term interactions is hard to find

Endogeneity of colocation - people aren't randomly in the same place

Measurement

---

---

## My approach

Quasi-experimental

Repeated interactions

Long-term outcomes

---

class: inverse, middle, center

## Setting

---

## NIH study sections

NIH panels that evaluate grant applications 

Convened by a Scientific Review Officer from the NIH

Organized around topics e.g. "Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy", "Cellular Signaling and Regulatory Systems"

---

## Criteria for reviewer selection

1. Expertise 

1. Study section must have enough breadth to cover its scientific area 

---

## Permanent vs. Temporary Members

Permanent members serve 4-year terms, 3 meetings a year

Temporary members are recruited on an ad hoc basis

Temporary memberships are sometimes used as tryouts for permanent membership

&lt;!-- Each meeting has on average 17 permanent and 13 temporary reviewers 
--&gt;

---

## What happens in a study section?

Each application is assigned 3 reviewers

Reviewers present their assessment of the application and discussion opens up to rest of panel

--

**What potential is there for knowledge diffusion?** What do reviewers actually talk about?

---

## Are reviewers different enough?

"I was always a minority, a clinical cardiologist, not an engineer. **So it was my job to defend cardiology science and explain it**" - Dr. David Sahn, Oregon Health Sciences University

---

## Do they learn from each other?

"I've come away grateful for the opportunity and consciously aware that **I learned some new science** and developed skills to **interact with people with different attitudes and opinions**" - Dr. Alice Clark, University of Mississippi

???

Suggests

1. reviewers are not entirely familiar with each other's fields
1. there are learning opportunities within the reviewing process

---

## Intellectual similarity

If scientists are too similar, may already be familiar with each other's work

If scientists are too distant, may be harder to use each other's knowledge

--

Effects may vary by intellectual similarity and could be non-monotonic

# Data

---

## Study section rosters

List of reviewers who attended a particular meeting for a particular study section

---

## Author-ity

Dataset of disambiguated author names ("John Smith" problem)

Derived from MEDLINE, repository for biomedical literature

---

## Citations

Clarivate Analytics Web of Science 

---

## Setup

Scientist pair (not ordered): `\((i, j) \equiv (j, i)\)`

Pair-year panel

---

## Sample



Over 14000 individuals matched out of 19000

235 study sections

Each panel has 29 members on average

Time period: 1992 to 2010, but most meetings observed are in 2006 or earlier

## Identification

Limit to permanent members of study sections

Make use of fixed 4-year terms (imputed)

---

## Identifying assumption

Use reviewer-pairs who served within 3 years of each other 

If scientists `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` served on a study section, *when* they were on the study section is exogenous

---

## Discussion

Repeated interactions matter - familiarity matters, not just awareness

Effects may be persistent

---

## Conclusions and future work

Repeated short-term interactions matter

Citations may not always capture knowledge recombination

Future work - other outcome variables, esp coauthorships

# The Effect of Targeted Increases in Science Funding: Stem Cell Research in California

---

## Background
- In 2004, California allocated &lt;span style="color:#D13434"&gt; $3 billion over 10 years &lt;/span&gt; towards stem cell research
- What is the effect of a large, targeted intervention on a specific area of science?

---

## Research Question

1. Did stem cell research in California increase? 
1. What were the effects of this increase in funding in equilibrium? 
    - How were other fields in biomedical science affected?
    - How did this new source of funding affect competition for NIH funding?
    - Did this affect scientists' location decisions? 
    
---

## Findings
- Use synthetic control method to compare scientific output of California against other states
- Led to increase of over 800 publications in stem cell research relative to control state
- No evidence of change in quality or novelty of average California paper

---

## Stem cells: a quick primer
- Can renew themselves and develop into specialized cells
- Human embryonic stem cells are *pluripotent*, that is, they can give rise to **any** type of cell
- Huge potential as research tool and for regenerative medicine, but...
- controversial due to use of human embryos in research 

---

## Timeline

&lt;img src="img/sc_events.gif" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Effects of Bush 2001 restrictions

- Furman et al (2012)
- U.S. stem cell research ⬇️ 
- But scientists at more prestigious institutions eventually recover by collaborating with overseas researchers
- Outcome variable: citations to core set of human embryonic stem cell articles
- Analysis ends slightly after California begins distributing funds

---

## State stem cell research funding programs


|  State|  First Grants Awarded|  Total Funding| Funding per year |
|--:| --:|--:|--:|
| California|  2006| $3b |$300m|
|  New York|  2008|  $600m|$55m|
| Maryland| 2007| (determined yearly)| $10-23 million|
| Connecticut | 2006 |$100m|$10m|


- NIH yearly funding of stem cell research is $1.2b to $1.5bn (fiscal years 2013 to 2017)

---

## Other work on impact of state programs

- Alberta et al (2015) look at publication trends in states with stem cell programs

---

## What did CIRM (California Institute of Regenerative Medicine) fund? 

- Basic science, infrastructure, applied research, clinical trials

&lt;!--
- $3 billion over 10 years, or \$300 million per year on average
- NIH estimates that it spends \$1.2 to \$1.4 billion per year on stem cell research 
--&gt;

---

## Data
- MEDLINE: repository of articles in the biomedical sciences
&lt;!--- Author-ity [@torvik2009]: links authors to publications --&gt;
- MapAffil (Torvik 2015): infers author location on MEDLINE articles
- Web of Science for article citations
&lt;!-- - Patent citations for patent citations --&gt;

---

## Defining stem cell publications: MeSH terms
- Extensive controlled vocabulary used to index MEDLINE database
- Articles are assigned MeSH terms by the National Library of Medicine

---

## Defining stem cell publications
- Hierarchical structure (up to 13 levels)
- All publications tagged with MeSH terms under "Stem Cell"

![](img/mesh_stemcell.png)

---

## Assigning states to publications

- MapAffil infers author location based on address listed on publication 

- This is typically the first author's address

- In biomedical sciences, first author has primary responsibility for the work

- We define a publication's state as the state of its first author's address

---

## Empirical strategy
- Use other states as control units for California

- Synthetic control method: use weighted average of non-California states to construct a "synthetic" California

- Variables used to construct weights: lagged outcomes averaged over 1995 to 1998, 1999 to 2002, and 2003 to 2006

---

## California systematically larger than other states

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Synthetic control assumptions

Synthetic control usually restricts synthetic California to be a **convex** combination of control states

---

## We relax those assumptions 

Doudchenko and Imbens: 

1. Allows for an intercept
1. Does not force weights to sum up to one
1. Allows weights to be negative

---

## Did California production of stem cell research increase?

- Publication counts 
- Citations by other articles

---

## Synthetic California
&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Inference for synthetic control: Placebo test

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Non-stem cell publications as placebo
- Could scientific productivity in California be increasing in general and not just for stem cell research?
- Should NOT expect to see similar "effects" for non-stem cell research

---

## No evidence of "effect" on non-stem cell research

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Citations by other publications

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Did CIRM fund more impactful/novel research?
- Purpose of state funding was to support research that federal funding could not
- We look at
    + "Birth" of new concepts
    + &lt;span style="color:grey"&gt; Adoption of new concepts &lt;/span&gt;
    + Citation count of average paper
    
---

## Average CA publication not more likely to have new concepts

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Average CA stem cell publication did not have more citations
&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Implied marginal product

- 0.5 to 0.7 papers per $1 million

- For comparison, Sattari and Weinberg (2017) estimate 2 papers per $1 million for NIH researchers

- CIRM funding does not always go directly to research projects

---

## Conclusions and future work

- Higher volume of publications from California, no change in impact of the average paper

- Finer categorizations of stem cell research

- Identify control fields

# Science, Interrupted: How Disruptions to Funding Affect Innovation

---

## My contribution

Federal funding supports a lot of economic activity

--

1. Innovation sector - NIH-funded biomedical research

--

1. Focus on *funding interruptions* as channel for uncertainty to affect innovative activity 

1. Transaction-level data - can observe activity at unusual level of detail

---

## Projects that experienced interrupted funding:

--

1. Spend 40-50% less per month in the last year of the project 

--

1. Spend 80-90% less in the first month after renewal, but catch up within 2 months

--

1. Spending unaffected in labs with multiple grants 

---

class: inverse, middle

## Background: Scientist perspective

---

## R01 grant mechanism

R01 grant is needed to sustain an independent lab

Usually last 4-5 years

Can be extended an additional year if you didn't spend all your money

---

## What happens when an R01 ends?

Have to renew the project

---

## Fail to renew

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Renewed and funded continuously
&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Renewed with interrupted funding

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Continuous vs. interrupted

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Renewal timeline (no hiccups)

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Background: NIH perspective

---

## Budgeting process

NIH budget is determined every fiscal year

Has to be approved by Congress

--

NIH is made up of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs), organized by disease or body system (e.g. National Cancer Institute, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)

Each IC manages its own budget

---

## Why are there interruptions?

There would be **no interruptions** if an IC knows 

1. Budget 

2. Quantity and "quality" of projects available to be funded   

---

## Why are there interruptions?

Uncertainty over:

--

#### Budget

Congressional stalemate over federal budget

--

#### Quality and quantity of projects

Multiple review cycles throughout the year

--

#### Both

IC risk-aversion towards spending too early

---

## Why might interruptions matter?

--

**Uncertainty** about whether or when funding will resume

--

Work may be **disrupted** even when funding resumes

---


## Interruptions over time

Data: NIH ExPorter

Public record of NIH-funded projects, including dates that projects were funded

Sample: R01s that expired and were renewed in the same fiscal year

A project is "interrupted" if its budget was renewed more than 30 days after expiry

---

## Interruptions over time

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## FY 1990 - 16% interrupted

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## FY 1996 - Government Shutdown

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Data and Empirical Strategy

---

## UMETRICS data

Transaction-level data on expenditures by sponsored projects 

Contemporaneous measure of research activity

26 universities

Coverage starts from 2001, heaviest from late 2000s onward

---

## Sample

Project-month panel

--

R01 projects

Awarded for 1 to 5 year terms - may extend

--

Monthly spending (transformed by inverse hyperbolic sine); approximate log differences
 
---

## How do projects spend funds?

## Peak spending in middle years

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Ramp down

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Measuring disruption

Diff-in-diff: 

1. How does spending change relative to plateau?

--

1. Projects with continuous funding vs. interrupted funding (~2000 projects)

--

Focus on spending 12 months before and after renewal

---

## Plateau

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Length of funding gap varies

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Length of funding gap may matter

Allow response to interruption to vary linearly by length of gap, in terms of 30-day intervals ("months")

---

## Continuous DiD model

`$$\begin{align} &amp; ihs(spending_{p,m}) = \\ &amp; \sum_{m = 1}^{12} \beta_{m}\textbf{1}(M_{p,m} = m)\color{#bb1200}{\textbf{1}(Gap_{p} &gt; 30 days)Gap_p} +  \\  &amp; \delta_{p} +  \epsilon_{p,m} \end{align}$$` 


`\(\textbf{1}(Gap_{p} &gt; 30 days)\)` - interrupted project

`\(Gap_p\)` - number of (calendar) days between expiring and renewed budget

---

## No difference in spending for interrupted *relative* to continuously funded

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 1 month gap -&gt; 25% decrease in spending 


&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

## Continuous diff-in-diff

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## What if a lab has multiple grants?

Labs may be able to offset disruption by using funds from other grants

--

Similar exercise with 

1. project-lab observations

1. Overall lab expenditure as outcome variable

--

How did spending by a lab change in response to a given R01 being interrupted?

---
### PIs with one R01

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### No decrease leading up to expiry

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Higher spending after renewal

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Does this affect productivity?

Look at publication counts, 5 years before and after R01 renewal

---
## No Controls

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## PI + Year FE

&lt;img src="defense_2019-07-12_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Conclusions and future work

- Interruptions affect spending

- How does spending affect workers? Do employees return to a PI's lab if they had to be "let go" during interruption?

- More publications after interruption? "Setback" hypothesis
