### Hard for funding agencies to plan

### Scientists feel this uncertainty too 

> "The uncertainty that the NIH feels reflects itself in my willingness to hire" - [David Cheresh, UCSD cancer researcher (Jan 2018)](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sd-me-shutdown-research-20180122-story.html)

## Challenges of studying the effect of this uncertainty

1. Measuring uncertainty 

1. Linking a particular "uncertainty shock" to behavior or outcomes

1. Hard to get individual-level variation in uncertainty

---

## What I do

1. Focus on **funding interruptions** - delays in between end of grant and start of grant

1. Transaction-level data - can observe research activity at high frequency and level of detail

---

## Labs that experienced interrupted funding:

1. Reduce spending in anticipation of not having funding

1. Even after funding resumes, take about 3-4 months to catch up

1. Having additional grants cushions impact on spending

1. *Suggestive* evidence of negative productivity effect

## Background: NIH perspective

---

## Budgeting process

NIH budget is determined every fiscal year

Has to be approved by Congress

--

NIH is made up of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs), organized by disease or body system (e.g. National Cancer Institute, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute)

Each IC manages its own budget

---

## Why are there interruptions?

There would be **no interruptions** if an IC knows 

1. Budget 

2. Quantity and "quality" of projects available to be funded   

---

## Interruptions arise because of uncertainty over: 

--
.pull-left[
### Budget

Congressional stalemate over federal budget
]

.pull-right[
### Quality/quantity of projects

Multiple review cycles throughout the year
]
--

Both factors are amplified by IC risk-aversion towards spending too early

---

## Why might interruptions matter?

Funds have to last longer than originally intended 

Uncertainty about whether or when funding will resume

Research may be disrupted even when funding resumes (frictions to acquiring inputs)

---

## Interruptions encompass a few types of "shocks"

Uncertainty about *whether* grant will be renewed

--

Uncertainty about *when* new funding will be available

--

Liquidity shock

## Transaction data from UMETRICS

Captures transactions from sponsored projects

31 universities

Coverage from 2001 to 2018 (heaviest from late 2000s onward)

---

## NIH ExPorter

Publicly available data on awards made including project start and end dates, budget size

Each project has at least one Principal Investigator (PI)

---

## Two levels of data

.pull-left[
### Inputs

- UMETRICS + ExPorter
- Monthly

]

.pull-right[
### Outputs 

- ExPorter + PubMed 
- Yearly
- How do interruptions affect productivity?
]

---

## Data setup

Identify all R01s that were renewed within the same fiscal year

Think of renewal as **event** that happens to a "lab" or PI (principal investigator)

Stack all renewal-labs to create balanced panels

In a unit-time panel, unit is a renewal-lab


---

class: inverse, middle

# Empirical strategy

---

## Some definitions:

- An R01 is *interrupted* if the time between expiry and renewal was greater than 30 calendar days

--

- Count number of R01-equivalent grants between 1 year before expiry and one year after renewal

- Create two subsets: PIs with one R01 and PIs with multiple R01-equivalents

---

# Event study for inputs

Project's budget could change after being renewed

--

Event study *within* budget $\implies$ Estimate expiring and renewed periods separately

# Why are interrupted projects longer?

Possible answer: PIs can ask for a no-cost extensions (extend grant by one year)

---

## Concern: Differential spending trends for awards of different lengths

*Especially* when an award lasts for longer than it was supposed to

--

I.e. Spending patterns of a 5-year project are different than for a "4 + 1"-year project

# What are the policy implications?

# Delayed funding has costs

What this paper doesn't say: optimal level of funding delays

Some interruptions are the result of macro factors (e.g. government shutdowns, delayed budget due to unrelated political disputes) $\Rightarrow$ current levels are unlikely to be optimal

---

## Interruptions are (to some extent) a policy choice

National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) prioritizes funding projects in time

> *If NIAID is operating under a CR, that won’t necessarily delay your award...we are assiduous about issuing awards* using funds from the CR. For example, by December 21, 2016, NIAID had already issued more than twice as many competing fiscal year 2017 grants as any other institute.
