## Discovery of The Double Helix

Central figures: Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin 

**In 1951, Watson saw Wilkins present at a conference in Naples**

This encounter prompted Watson to move to Cambridge and change the direction of his research

---

class: middle

## What is the effect of short-term interactions on collaboration and knowledge diffusion?

---

## Challenges

Data on short-term interactions is hard to find

Endogeneity of colocation - people aren't randomly in the same place

---

## My approach: NIH study sections

NIH panels that evaluate grant applications 

20-30 people in each panel

Convened by a Scientific Review Officer from the NIH

Organized around topics e.g. "Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy", "Cellular Signaling and Regulatory Systems"

---

## Identification strategy

Reviewers serve 4-year terms i.e. ~ a quarter will rotate off every year

Treatment: serving together on a study section

Control: Just missed serving together on a study section

---

## Data setup

Yearly panel of scientist-pairs

Outcome variable - Number of times a scientist-pair cite each other in a year

---

# The Effect of Targeted Increases in Science Funding: Stem Cell Research in California 
### w/Joseph Staudt

---

## Background

- Bush administration instituted federal restrictions on funding for stem cell research
- In 2004, California allocated <span style="color:#D13434"> $3 billion over 10 years </span> towards stem cell research
- What is the effect of a large, targeted intervention on a specific area of science?

---

## Timeline

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sc_events.gif")
```

---

## Research Question

1. Did stem cell research in California increase?

1. How did the quality of research change?

### Other questions we haven't answered

Did this affect scientists' location decisions? 

How did this new source of funding affect competition for NIH funding?

---

## State stem cell research funding programs
```{r}
# stateprogs = tribble(
#   ~State, ~`First Grants Awarded`, ~`Total Funding`, ~`Funding Per Year`,
#   "California", 2006, "$3bn", "$300m",
#   "New York", 2008, ""
# )
```

|  State|  First Grants Awarded|  Total Funding| Funding per year |
|--:| --:|--:|--:|
| California|  2006| $3b |$300m|
|  New York|  2008|  $600m|$55m|
| Maryland| 2007| (determined yearly)| $10-23 million|
| Connecticut | 2006 |$100m|$10m|


- NIH yearly funding of stem cell research is $1.2b to $1.5bn (fiscal years 2013 to 2017)

---

## Estimation

Synthetic control method - often used for case studies 

Construct a weighted combination of non-California states that look like California before the policy took effect

---

```{r}

lab.y_pubs = "No. of Publications"
lab.y_cites = "No. of Citations"

synth = read_csv(there(stemcells, "results/synth_data.csv"))
labeldf = tribble(
  ~year, ~y, ~treated,
  2007L, 550, "CA", 
  2009L, 360, "Synthetic"
)
synth %>% 
  filter(depvar == "sc_pubs", ca_donor == "CA", state == "CA") %>% 
  gather(k, y, c(outcome, synth))  %>% 
  mutate(treated = if_else(k == "outcome", "CA", "Synthetic")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, y, colour = treated, linetype = treated)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_label(data = labeldf, aes(colour = treated, label = treated), size = 6) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2006, linetype = 2) + 
  labs(y = lab.y_pubs, x = "Year", subtitle = "Only one donor state, Massachusetts") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1, 2))
```

---

## Average CA publication not more/less likely to have new concepts

```{r}
concepteffects = synth %>% 
  filter(depvar == "sc_concept_orig_sum", ca_donor == "CA") %>% 
  mutate(effect = outcome - synth, tmp = state == "CA")
layer1 = concepteffects %>% 
  filter(state != "CA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, effect, colour = state)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2006, linetype = 2) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(y = lab.y_pubs, x = "Year") 


layer1 + 
  geom_line(data = filter(concepteffects, state == "CA"), 
                   aes(year, effect), colour = "red", 
            size = 1.2) + 
  geom_label(data = data.frame(year = 2008.5, effect = 5, state = "CA"),
          aes(label = state), size = 6, colour = "red") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(rep("grey", 50))) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0L, linetype = 2)
```

---

## No change in citations for the average CA stem cell publication 
```{r}
meanciteeffects = synth %>% 
  filter(depvar == "sc_fc_mean", ca_donor == "CA") %>% 
  mutate(effect = outcome - synth, tmp = state == "CA") 
layer1 = meanciteeffects %>% 
  filter(state != "CA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, effect, colour = state)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2006, linetype = 2) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(y = lab.y_pubs, x = "Year") 

layer1 + 
  geom_line(data = filter(meanciteeffects, state == "CA"), 
                   aes(year, effect), colour = "red", 
            size = 1.2) + 
  geom_label(data = data.frame(year = 2008.5, effect = 5, state = "CA"),
          aes(label = state), size = 6, colour = "red") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(rep("grey", 50))) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0L, linetype = 2)
```

## Takeaways

Increase in volume of research

No change in quality, novelty of research

---

## Next steps

Scientist-level analysis - create matched controls for scientists based in CA when the policy was implemented

Control groups: Stem cell researchers outside California; Non-stem cell researchers in California

Dig into scientist migration patterns 

---

## Random future ideas that I will probably never get to

Science of science: Constructing an uncertainty index for scientific research; estimating the effect of uncertainty on scientists' choice of projects; understanding entry/exit into the scientific labor force in response to funding shocks (different responses by gender, scientist "type")

Open source: how to value and sustain "infrastructure" in science

Bayesian stats: connecting treatment effects to a loss function that we can use to make decisions
