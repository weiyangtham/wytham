I introduce quasi-experimental methods (e.g. difference-in-differences and instrumental variables) that have become commonplace in empirical economics and many other social sciences. I will use a variety of examples from business cases and economics research. By the end of this talk, the audience will walk away with a strong intuition for what these methods can and cannot do, and how they can be applied across multiple contexts.
