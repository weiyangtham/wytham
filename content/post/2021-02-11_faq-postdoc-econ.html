<p>Hi! We wrote this post to help prospective postdocs, current postdocs, or even people who want to hire postdocs understand what it’s like doing a postdoc in economics (and similar fields like management) is like. Please treat it as a <em>living document</em> that will evolve as we get feedback and better information.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Take note that this is also a very US-centric guide, but it’s the system we know best (and even then there’s a lot we don’t know!)</p>
<div id="what-is-a-postdoc" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a postdoc?</h2>
<p>The NSF and NIH define a postdoc as “an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path.” This is not a bad definition but still kinda vague, so let’s try to get more specific.</p>
<p>In economics, what this basically means is you work for 2-3 years with a mentor with the expectation that this prepares you to go on the market for your next job.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s a rough taxonomy of econ postdocs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Standard” postdoc: hired to work on a specific project or at least projects in a certain domain (and will have to go on the market again!)</li>
<li>Postdocs that are more like fellowships: for people who already have jobs lined up and basically get an extra year or so to work on their own on whatever they want.</li>
<li>Anything else in-between, including but not limited to: you’re hired to work on specific areas or with specific people but you also have a job lined up once the postdoc is over; or you’re hired by a department but not a specific supervisor within the department</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of postdoc (“standard”) is the one we have mind as we’re writing this, but different parts of the guide will have some relevance to other kinds of postdocs.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-postdocs-in-economics-earn" class="section level2">
<h2>What do postdocs in economics earn?</h2>
<p>If you know of good data on this, let us know!</p>
<p>We tried using the Survey of Doctorate Recipients public use data (pooling 2015, 2017, 2019 waves), which returns an average of $60,000, but that’s based on 57 observations.</p>
<p>Based on the SDR and informal knowledge, <em>our current best guess is that a typical econ postdoc salary is in the range of $60-65,000</em>, but we’d love to hear if you think that’s inaccurate.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-benefits-do-postdocs-get" class="section level2">
<h2>What benefits do postdocs get?</h2>
<p>This is even trickier than salaries. Benefits are gonna depend on how your specific university classifies postdocs. If postdocs are classified as staff, then you’ll have staff benefits and pay the same insurance premiums and get 401(k) matching. If postdocs are classified as a student or “student-adjacent”, you might receive different benefits like student loan deferment and not having to pay health insurance premiums, but you might also miss out on other perks that staff get.</p>
<p>In short, you should ask about this.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-visa-do-i-use-for-non-us-citizens" class="section level2">
<h2>What visa do I use (for non-US citizens)?</h2>
<p>(Usual disclaimer that we aren’t immigration lawyers. Triple check all this with your school’s international affairs office and/or actual immigration law experts)</p>
<p>If you’re already in the US on an F1 visa, the most straightforward route is probably to use your OPT (1 year), and then the STEM OPT extension (2 more years). Otherwise, postdocs usually use the J1 visa</p>
</div>
<div id="what-should-i-ask-about-or-negotiate-over" class="section level2">
<h2>What should I ask about or negotiate over?</h2>
<div id="extending-the-postdoc" class="section level3">
<h3>Extending the postdoc</h3>
<p>Ideally, you’ll finish your postdoc and go off to your fancy new job in no time! But sometimes stuff goes wrong (maybe a project doesn’t work out or there’s a pandemic) so it’s worth asking early on what the possibilites of extending the postdoc are. There’s a decent chance your supervisor can’t give a definitive answer, but you might still gain valuable information (e.g. are they thinking of applying for more funding?)</p>
</div>
<div id="responsibilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Some postdocs are set up such that you’re working on a specific project. What percenage of your time are you expected to devote to that project versus your own projects? Does that project have a fixed timeline? If something happens to that project, will you still be funded?</p>
</div>
<div id="authorship" class="section level3">
<h3>Authorship</h3>
<p>How will authorship be decided? Will there be opportunities to carve out your own “slice” of the project (especially if the main project you’re working on will have many authors)?</p>
</div>
<div id="teaching" class="section level3">
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>This could work either way. Some postdocs involve teaching, so you’ll want to find out if that is so and how much work it will involve. Or you might want to do some teaching, perhaps because you didn’t have much teaching experience in grad school. If so, it’s worth asking if there might be opportunies to do that.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-support" class="section level3">
<h3>Research Support</h3>
<p>What kind of financial support can you get to do research and build your network? Items you might want to ask about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference expenses (travel, registration fees)</li>
<li>Journal submission fees</li>
<li>Computing equipment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="relationship-with-supervisor" class="section level3">
<h3>Relationship with supervisor</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is your supervisor’s mentoring style? How often will you be able to get on their calendar?</li>
<li>Who else are you reporting to?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="relationship-with-department" class="section level3">
<h3>Relationship with department</h3>
<p>Postdocs are in a bit of a weird position. You don’t enter with a cohort of classmates like in undergrad or grad school but you’re not faculty either. Some things you might want to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is your office? Is it in the same building as people you want to know?</li>
<li>Can you attend seminars?</li>
<li>Can you present in the dept seminar?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="moving-costs" class="section level3">
<h3>Moving costs</h3>
<p>Can your supervisor or department help with moving costs in any way? Even if they can’t cover all your moving expenses, there may be little things they can do to ease the transition like flying you out in advance to look for housing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="going-on-the-marketagain" class="section level2">
<h2>Going on the market…again!</h2>
<div id="do-i-need-a-new-job-market-paper" class="section level3">
<h3>Do I need a new Job Market Paper?</h3>
<p>Yes. The only situation where we’re not as sure this applies is if you do a 1-year postdoc i.e. go on consecutive markets</p>
</div>
<div id="do-you-have-publications-or-rrs" class="section level3">
<h3>Do you have publications or R&amp;Rs?</h3>
<p>It’s not necessarily the end of the world if you don’t, but of course it would help a lot.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-is-going-to-write-your-rec-letters" class="section level3">
<h3>Who is going to write your rec letters?</h3>
<p>Presumably your postdoc supervisor will be one of them, but you might also want one of your old letter writers (say, your advisor) to write one again. In that case, make an effort to keep them updated on your progress.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-your-supervisor-support-your-job-search" class="section level3">
<h3>How will your supervisor support your job search?</h3>
<ul>
<li>What kind of administrative support can you get from the department or will you rely on your old department?</li>
<li>Are they ok with you spending paid time to apply to jobs, go to interviews, do flyouts, etc., even if your job market paper is unrelated to the postdoc?</li>
<li>Is your supervisor supportive of the type of jobs you are looking for? (academia vs industry, different types of jobs within academia)</li>
</ul>
