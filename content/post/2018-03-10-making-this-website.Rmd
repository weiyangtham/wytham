Using `blogdown` to make this website was an absolute joy. My only advice is to follow the [great instructions from Alison Premanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) and [her related set of slides](https://alison.rbind.io/slides/blogdown-workshop-slides.html). Godspeed!
