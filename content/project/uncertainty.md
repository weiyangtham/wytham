Uncertainty over a funding agencyâ€™s budget can interrupt the flow of funding to research projects. Using transaction-level data on NIH-sponsored projects, I study the effect of funding interruptions on innovative activity. I find that researchers respond to the uncertainty from funding interruptions by reducing spending in the months leading up to the expiry of funding. Spending is substantially lower in the first month after funding resumes but recovers within 2 months, suggesting that interruptions have a disruptive effect on research even when funds become available. These findings suggest that the timing of funding is an important factor for agencies to consider when they make research awards.
