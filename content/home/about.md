# Biography

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in economics at The Ohio State University. My research lies at the intersection of labor economics and innovation, with implications for urban and public economics. I am also an R enthusiast.

My job market paper is available [here](/pdf/uncertainty.pdf). I will be available for interviews at the 2019 ASSA Meetings in Atlanta.
